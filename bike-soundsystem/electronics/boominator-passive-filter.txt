It's the filter I designed. I have since redrawn it.

Note that the 4 ohm resistor can exchanged or varied between 2 and 4 ohm depending on taste. Changing the resistor value between these values doesn't really attenuate the tweeter response as a whole as the lower total impedance at the same time also sets the cut-off higher resulting in pretty much the same overall response. It does however change the amount and shape of the very highest frequency boost which is there to compensate for loss at off-axis response at those frequencies. Also, people who generally prefer electronic music also tends to prefer that. Try it with 4 ohm and 2 ohm and see which you prefer. Or for example 3.3 ohm if you like. I prefer the 4 ohm as it gives the most natural sound with a distinct acoustic feel.
